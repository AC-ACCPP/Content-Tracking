The bones of centuries-dead drudges, mosswarts, and banderlings, rattle against one another in the wind. The skin stretched across it, legend tells, is made from flesh of Zhuaruf, a Tumerok birthed from the union of the Hea shaman Niheaua and his own dream-spun daughter.

Not as good as larchess was reputed to be, at least according to that overweening blowhard Locke. If only my hatchet could chip those damned glowing trees! Floating creatures still dogging me, but wary since I punctured that 'mouthless' one."" - Lilitha",sublimeelaribow,Retail,,,,,
